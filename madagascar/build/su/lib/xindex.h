/*< Determine index of x with respect to an array of x values

Output:
index		for monotonically increasing ax values, the largest index
		for which ax[index]<=x, except index=0 if ax[0]>x;
		for monotonically decreasing ax values, the largest index
		for which ax[index]>=x, except index=0 if ax[0]<x
******************************************************************************
Notes:
This function is designed to be particularly efficient when called
repeatedly for slightly changing x values; in such cases, the index 
returned from one call should be used in the next. >*/
