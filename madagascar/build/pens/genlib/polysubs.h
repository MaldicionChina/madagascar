/*< Do a simple-minded polygon clipping. If it goes out, draw it to where it
 * crossed the edge. When it comes back in, draw it from where it hit the
 * edge. This is complicated if you have to deal with several edges, but
 * very easy for one edge. So, since I'm lazy, I did it four times, each
 * routine reading in points, clipping, and sending the output on for
 * further clipping. Finally, it sends it on to polyfix which does
 * complicated processing. JAD 5-11-84 >*/
